          <br>Currently in ideation and
research stage for selecting ideas. Team has been formed as follows:&nbsp;<br>Sean
Clarke, Maadhava Ravishankar, Rukshi Thiyagayogan, Henry Zhou.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>The initial
ideas proposed:&nbsp;<br>- Fire search and rescue
robot&nbsp;<br>- Security monitoring drone
swarm<br>-&nbsp;Anti-car theft system (to
prevent CAN injections)<br>- Surveying drone system&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">17/09/24</span>
          <br>After consultation with
advisors, further research and contacting agencies the following conclusions
were reached about each of the ideas:&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          <span style="text-decoration: underline !important;">Fire search and rescue
robot</span>
          <br>- Spoke with Troy FD in
Michigan about use cases for robotics in firefighting applications, and was
told that the most applicable cases would likely be in urban environments. Was
redirected to contact Toronto FD and Mississauga FD instead.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          <span style="text-decoration: underline !important;">Security monitoring drone
swarm</span>
          <br>- Drones are very expensive,
obtaining/working with multiple of them is not feasible given our time frame
and budget&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          <span style="text-decoration: underline !important;">Anti-car theft system
(to prevent CAN injections)</span>
          <br>- Manufacturer dependent, no
access to a physical system to test with&nbsp;<br>- Schematics are proprietary,
no information available online&nbsp;<br>- Problem is already set to
be solved in software primarily; no mechanical aspects&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          <span style="text-decoration: underline !important;">Surveying Drone System</span>
          <br><!--[if !supportLists]-->-&nbsp;<!--[endif]-->Not enough budget to
develop custom drone, however RoboHub has drones available we can develop a
payload for&nbsp;<br>- Met with Branon DeHart to
discuss options&nbsp;<br>- Potentially integrate LiDAR
and RTK GPS to obtain precision accuracy&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">24/09/24</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          <span style="text-decoration: underline !important;">Fire robot</span>
          <span style="text-decoration: underline !important;">:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><!--[if !supportLists]-->-&nbsp;<!--[endif]-->Talked to multiple Toronto
Fire agency representatives including the fire safety and engineering team.
Spoke with other fire departments, including Troy FD in Michigan, and attempted
to visit a fire station in Mississauga. They indicated the best use case for
robotics would be for search and rescue applications in condos, high-rises, and
other densely packed spaces.&nbsp;<!--[if !supportLists]-->
          <br>
          <br>- Would require very
expensive materials to build a robot capable of withstanding fire temperatures,
as well as electronics that are capable of withstanding the operating
conditions.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>- Would be very difficult to
navigate terrain, drone system would have limited flight time (current record
by a company for fireproof drone is 10 minutes)<br>
          <br>
          <span style="text-decoration: underline !important;">Architectural/Construction
Surveying:</span>
          <br>- Continued research on
problem, two approaches on which aspects of surveying to address: <!--[if !supportLists]-->ยง&nbsp;&nbsp;<!--[endif]-->
          <br>
          <br>Indoor - Would have to be able to
network outside house for RTK GPS to work, must avoid obstacles/ be
nimble enough<br>Outdoor - Be able to withstand
external weather conditions, must be able to fly
high/scan a large volume&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>

digital terrain mapping, and in particular a method for producing digital
terrain maps of the vicinity around large rotating machinery, such as
draglines, shovels, excavators, wheel loaders or cranes. The method involves
the following steps: Mounting a 2-Dimensions laser scanner and a high-accuracy
RTK GPS system to an item of large rotating machinery, at a radial extremity of
the machinery. Arranging the laser scanner to record radial lines of data
representing the terrain below the extremity of the machinery. Rotating the
machinery completely about its axis of rotation and generating data from both
the laser scanner and GPS system that represents the terrain around the
machinery. Wherein, a calibration is conducted by recording data from markers
at known locations in the terrain below the extremity of the machinery to
determine the relative positions of the laser scanner centre and the GPS
antenna, the orientation of the laser scanner and the time lag between the data
generated from both the laser scanner and the GPS system. In a further aspect
the invention concerns equipment for use in the method and software.&nbsp;<br>

          <br>Changed the 4th
proposed solution of individual base stations with an omni-wheel wheel robot
that has a high-resolution camera to perform Structure from Motion (SfM)
photogrammetry, as the base station design did not meet sufficient constraints.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Met Brandon in person and
he redirected us to contact several companies including VSemi and the VIP lab
about sourcing/borrowing parts.<br>
          <br>At Brandonโs suggestion,
the following change was made:<br>- A combination of solution 1
and 2 was selected โ Stereo Camera with LiDAR integration. In addition, our
scope was narrowed to exclusively working outside of a building, with a focus
on residential housing as a first step.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

          <br>Failed to source a LiDAR
that can be mounted on a drone and works outdoors (VSemi did not respond yet)<br>
          <br>Spoke to research students
at the CViSS Lab regarding what gaps exist in drone 3D mapping&nbsp;<br>
          <br>- Drone mapping is already a
well understood problem, with many platforms supporting photogrammetry and SfM&nbsp;<br>- Processing happens offline
and requires heavy cloud computation&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Pivoted to heavily
emphasize on real time 3D reconstruction, as this area has not been explored
and enables obstacle detection and single-pass reconstruction without the need
to fail in missed areas&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Design 1 (drone with RGBD)
was chosen instead of design 2 (drone with RGBD + LiDAR) because it better
supports real time processing and because of the inability to source a LiDAR
that meets requirements<br>

          <br>Detailed design has
commenced. We are considering borrowing a Matrice drone from RoboHub. It was
recommended that we use the Matrice 210 V1 from RoboHub. The system will
consist of a gimbal mounted underneath a box containing the payload
electronics.&nbsp;<!--[if !supportLists]-->
          <br>
          <br>Prototype interface code
(driver) for the UM982 driver started, including research into NTRIP and the
NMEA 0183 protocol it uses to send GPS data. Some open source libraries were
found that support our use case.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>CAD designs for the payload
with selected components are developed&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

              <br>Hand calculations were performed
for gimbal design to validate operation in moderate conditions.<br>
              <br>CAD designs for the gimbal
have been developed. Wires were routed internally, and we were able to reuse
(2x) MG966R servo motors that Sean previously had. Design will be 3D printed
and assembled for early stage prototyping.&nbsp;&nbsp;

          <br>Camera gimbal prototype has
been assembled and functions well. There were some 3D printing issues that
needed to be mitigated (i.e. adjusting wall thicknesses) but the rest printed
well as shown. The design will need to be reprinted for the final product as
the height of the mounting arm needs to be reduced otherwise it will hit the
ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Started work on the WebRTC
protocol stack required to transport video data off the drone for processing.
WebRTC is a complex collection of protocols and systems for establishing a UDP
connection between two devices (peers), neither of which has a public IP. Some
work will be required to fully understand the UDP hole punching mechanism.&nbsp;<!--[if !supportLists]-->

          <br>Progress has been made on
testing the servo actuation using an Arduino and basic motor driver, range of
motion is good. Wires do not get caught. Helped Henry with software validation
testing.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Got in touch with Alexander
Werner from RoboHub and visited him in person to measure the V1 drone and take
important dimensions for the SkyPort mounting.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Finalized borrowing of the
V1 drone, with each group member completing required training.<br>
          <br>WebRTC requires a
standalone channel for initial signaling before the connection can be
established. A HTTP server prototype was designed for this.<br>
          <br>RealSense camera received
and tested. Success in extracting the depth stream and muxing it with the RGB
stream for a unified camera stream, using the recommended โHueโ color map to
encode depth information.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Began looking into
correlation mechanisms between the image data and GPS pose data. Two initial
ideas are being researched: <!--[if !supportLists]-->o&nbsp; -&nbsp;<!--[endif]-->Encoding the GPS data into
each video frame for decoding by the host device.&nbsp;<br>- Sending the GPS data
through a channel separate from the video stream, and stamping each video and
GPS frame with an ID for correlation.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<!--[if !supportLists]-->
